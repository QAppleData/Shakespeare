# Shakespeare
I am trying to understand how it is done follow the link here:
https://github.com/spro/practical-pytorch/blob/master/char-rnn-generation/char-rnn-generation.ipynb
However, it ran into a error that I cant debug, I think it is related to this topic:
https://github.com/hunkim/PyTorchZeroToAll/issues/24
But I can't figure out how to solve this.
